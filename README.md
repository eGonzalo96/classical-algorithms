Classical algorithms implementations.

This repo contains the source code (java, pytho, ruby, kotlin, etc)
of several classical algorithms such as Quicksort, Dijsktra's Algorithm,
Binary Search and more. Its purpose is to share my progress as a programmer.

Comments, advices, critics are welcome. :)
Happy coding!
